# MCLA_code
This repository contains the code for the Multi-color Light Attenuation (MCLA) algorithm developed by Zhou et al. The code is written in MATLAB.

# Usage
To use the code, simply download the repository and run the demo.m script in MATLAB. The script takes as input an underwater image and returns the restored image using the MCLA algorithm.
